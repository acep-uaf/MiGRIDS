    <!-- but some kinetic energy storage systems may also have a fixed or variable AC bus. -->

    stated as a fuel consumption per kWh, kg/kWh. It is added to the effective fuel consumption of discharging the
     ESS resulting from chargning it with the diesel generators. The cost is used to account for non-fuel costs of
     discharging the ESS including maintenance and lifetime costs. Units are kg/kWh. Default is 0. This should be updated
      to avoid overuse of the ESS. -->
