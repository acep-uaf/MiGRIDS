    <!-- component descriptions should state the immediate parent here. All have to be traceable to this interface. -->

    temperature in Kelvin. 'tempHeatingMin' is the minimum temperature required for the heating fluid used to heat the
    component. 'pt' is the thermal power consumption in kW. This will be supplied by whatever excess heat is
    available -->

    fluid) Units for power are P.U. of nameplate power capacity, for heat output are thermal kW (not electric) and for
    temperature are Kelvin. Default is to have a data point at 0 and 1 P.U. power output of no heat recovery and at room
    temperature. -->
