    <!-- 'thermalConductanceInsulation' is the thermal conductance of the thermal storage insulation. Thermal convection
    and radiation will be assumed to be 10% of the calculated conductance loss and will be accounted for by adding 10%
    to the calculated thermal losses (http://www.process-heating.com/articles/87988-calculating-heat-loss)
    Units are W/K. Default is 0.  -->

    <!-- 'thermalConductanceExchanger' is thermal conductance of the heat exchanger used to transfer heat from the
      heat transfer medium and the thermal storage medium. This is only used when the thermal storage is heated with
      heat recovered from another process. 'conversionEfficiency' is used when directly heated with electricity or an
       oil burner.
       Units are W/K, the Default is 0-->
    <thermalConductanceExchanger value="0" unit="W/K"/>

    <!-- 'conversionEfficiency' is the efficiency of converting electrical to thermal energy. There are no units. It is
      expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1. Defualt is 1. -->
    <conversionEfficiency value="1" unit="NONE"/>

    <!-- 'amdbientTemperature' is the ambient temperature around the thermal storage. If 'useAmbientTemperatureProfile'
       is a set to FALSE, then the temperature listed here will be used as the ambient temperature to calculate heat
       loss. If it is set to TRUE, this value is not used. Default value is 298 K (25 C). Units are Kelvin.  -->
