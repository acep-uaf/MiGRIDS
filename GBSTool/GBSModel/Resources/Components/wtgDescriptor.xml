<!-- This file describes a general wind turbine generator. Specific WTG might require further children. -->

<!-- Root tag is 'component' -->

    <!-- WTG specific parameters -->
    <!-- 'powerCurve' describes the power curve of the wind turbine as a set of tuples of 'ws' and 'p' tags. -->
    <!-- Wind speed has units of m/s. power should be presented as P.U. of the nameplate real power capacity. -->
    <!-- Default is to have a data point at 0 m/s and at nameplate power. DEFAULT VALUES REQUIRE CHANGING for this to -->
    <!-- be sensible. -->

    <!-- 'cutInWindSpeed' describes the minimum wind speed at which the turbine will begin producing power from a -->
    <!-- previous complete stop. The default value is 0, which NEVER makes sense. Units are m/s. -->
    <cutInWindSpeed value="0" unit="m/s"/>
    <!-- 'cutOutWindSpeedMax' describes the maximum wind speed at which a turbine still produces power. Default value -->
    <!-- is 0, which NEVER makes sense. Units are m/s. -->
    <cutOutWindSpeedMax value="0" unit="m/s"/>
    <!-- 'cutOutWindSpeedMin' describes the minimum wind speed at which a turbine stops producing power due to lack of -->

    <cutOutWindSpeedMin value="0" unit="m/s"/>

    <!-- 'spilledWindLimit' is the amount of spilled wind power that is the limit before a flag is set to initiate
      scheduling new diesel and energy storage units. Units are in PU of nameplate capacity times seconds. It is measured
      over the period of time indicated by checkWindTime. Default is 60 PU. -->

     PU of instantaneous grid import. Defualt value is 0.75. -->
